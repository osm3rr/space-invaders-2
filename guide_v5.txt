#/// Video 3: adding images ///
.0 Review the was done in the previous video
.1 select and download a player image (64 px) in the web site flaticon
.2 put the selected image in the project folder
.3 explain how is are x and y coordinates in the window
.4 create a variable with palyer image
.5 create a variable with x ubication
.6 create a variable with y ubication
.7 define the function player
.8 explain the use of blit method 
.9 use the correct argument for blit
.10 call the player function inside the while loop
.11 explain the correct position of the call to function player
.12 play with diferents positions in x and y coordinates for the player
.13 run the program
.14 add the file in staging area in git
.15 do it a commit 
.16 change of branch
.17 do it a merge
.18 do it the push

#/// Video 4: Movement mechanics ///
.0 review what has been done so far
.1 explain the movement mechanins in blackboard
.2 explain the need to use x and y coordinates
.3 add in the player function the parameter x and y
.4 add the arguments in the call to player function 
inside the while lopp
.5 run the program -> no changes yet
.6 add a counter inside the while loop, for increment x speed 
the first value is 5
.7 explain what it means the counter
.8 run the program and show what happens
.9 change the increment by 0.1 in the player x variable
.10 run the program and show the diference
.11 if we have time: add a print(player_x) for 
for demonstration purposes
.12 clean the terminal before run de program
.13 change the counter value by -0.1 for explain
the left movement
.14 for demonstration purposes, change the y counter 
and change the argument in the print
.15 explain the problems to solve: 
associate player movement with keyboard arrows
.16 add the file in staging area in git
.17 do it a commit 
.18 change of branch
.19 do it a merge
.20 do it the push


#/// Video 5: keyboard input control 
and key pressed event///
.0 review what has been done so far
.1 explain what we want to control
.2 explain the strategy:
  - first we want review if a key was pressed
  - second we want review what key was pressed
.3 remove the counter player_y and the 
test print( player_y )
.4 explain the event key pressed in the for loop
.5 add the conditional inside the for loop,
 to identify the keystroke was pressed
.6 add a nested conditional for identify the left 
and the right arrow 
.7 add a conditional to identify the keystroke was
released
.8 execute the program and show what 
is happening in the terminal
.9 add the variable for the rate of change of 
the player's speed at x
.10 add inside the conditional the variable for 
the rate of change of the player's speed at x
.10
