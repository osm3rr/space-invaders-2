#/// Video 10: Creating bullets for shooting///
.0 review what has been done so far
.1 explain the movement logic of the bullets
.2 download the bullet image from flaticon: 24 px
.3 create the bullet parameters (copy from enemy)
.4 explain the y coordinate of the bullet
.5 run the program to check the bullet position
.6 define the fire function after the enemy function
.7 inside the fire function define bullet_state like 
global variable, for change the value inside the function
.8 put bullet_state = "fire"
.9 add 16 to "y" and 10 to "x" for the correct position
in the screen
.10 change the value of the rate to change of the bullet by 10
.11 add a conditional inside the for loop, for detect
the space key
.12 add the logic for bullet movement after 
enemy movement
.13 now we have two problems: 
   1. one shoot 
   2. the bullet moves with the spaceship
* the solution in the next part
.14 review what has been done so far
.15 add the file in staging area in git
.16 do a commit
